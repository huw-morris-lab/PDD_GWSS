#Conditional analysis was run in GCTA-COJO (https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#COJO)
#Three files are needed for the analysis:
  #list of SNPs to condition the analysis on (cond.snplist)
  #summary-level statistics from a meta-analysis GWAS (file.ma)
  #plink binary files from a reference sample 
#The entire AMP-PD dataset was used to generate a reference file using the QC steps decribed in step 1_
