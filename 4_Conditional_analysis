#Conditional analysis was run in GCTA-COJO (https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#COJO)
#Three files are needed for this analysis:
  #SNP or list of SNPs on which the analysis is conditioned (cond.snplist)
  #summary-level statistics from a meta-analysis GWAS 
  #plink binary files from a reference sample 
#The entire AMP-PD dataset was used to generate a REFERENCE file using the QC steps decribed in step 1_Data_quality_control 
#The reference file was then converted to build hg19 using liftOver tool

#PREPARE COJO FILE FROM THE SUMMARY STATISTICS (SNP A1 A2 freq b se p N)
awk '{print $1"\t"$3"\t"$2"\t"$4"\t"$8"\t"$9"\t"$10"\t"$16}' SURVIVAL_DEMENTIA_META_ALL_COHORTS1.tbl > metal.ma

#CONDITION ON A SINGLE SNP 
chr=chromosome_number
snp_id=SNP on which conditional analysis is being performed
